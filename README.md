# weather-api

## Description

```md
The development of challenge 6 meant another great opportunity
to continue practicing application coding and consolidate the 
knowledge of the first stage of the bootcamp.
Even though challenge 6 is very similar to project 1, the
integral development of the site allowed me to consolidate the
knowledge in the use of the different tools.

Challenge 6 consists of coding a weather board obtaining the
information from an API (application programming interface),
offering a friendly interface to the end user. 

I developed challenge 6 to deepen in the use and management of
an API, (In this case that of “OpenWeatherMap”). Subscribing to
the site, obtaining the key and reviewing the documentation
allowed me to have clarity in the implementation of this type
of tool.
After learning about the extensive weather information that 
"OpenWeatherMap" offers, it is clear to me that there is the 
possibility to continue experimenting and adding more 
functionalities to the site.

Challenge 6 was also an opportunity to put my newly acquired 
knowledge into practice. I chose to use the bootstrap framework 
for the structured and responsive design of the site. Likewise, 
for the dynamic design of the site, I decided to use the 
facilities of the “Jquery” library.

Finally, challenge 6 allowed me to implement again the use 
of local storage to give more functionality to the site.

During this challenge I was able to identify the following:
    - The advantage of using bootstrap for responsive design.
    - The incompatibility between bootstrap and CSS styling.
    - The advantage of using Jquery and simplifying dynamic HTML design.
    - The power of Chrome's toolDev for debugging code. 

During this challenge (6) I learned
    - The concept and use of an API.
    - The “bootstrap” structure.
    - The importance of being very careful when typing the code to avoid errors that are not so easy to identify.
    - The importance of reading the available documentation to identify possible conflicts between the different tools being used.
